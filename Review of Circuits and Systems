## 1. Define electricity and electronics in your own words. Highlight the key differences between the two terms.

Electricity is the form of energy that comes from the movement of electric charges (usually electrons) through a conductor. It is mainly concerned with the generation, transmission, and use of electrical power to do work such as lighting, heating, or running motors.

Electronics is the branch of science and engineering that deals with controlling and manipulating electrical signals using electronic components like resistors, capacitors, diodes, and transistors. It focuses on processing information, signals, and data rather than delivering raw power.


### Key Differences Between Electricity and Electronics
Electricity: Focus on Producing and delivering electrical power, Usually high current and high voltage, it purpose is to Power devices and systems. 
Component often used are Generators, transformers, motors, power lines. 

Electronics: Focus on Controlling and processing electrical signals and it is usually low current and low voltage. it purporse is making devices “smart” and functional. component used are Resistors, diodes, transistors, ICs, microcontrollers and typical applications are Computers, smartphones, IoT devices, control systems.

## 2. Choose a specific electronic device or system and explain how electronics contribute to its functionality. Highlight the role of electronic components.

### Automatic Washing Machine
An automatic washing machine is an example of how electronics contribute to the intelligent control and efficient operation of a device.

How electronics contribute to its functionality
Electronics allow the washing machine to automatically control washing cycles, water levels, timing, and motor speed based on the program selected by the user. Instead of relying on manual control, electronic circuits help process inputs and make decisions that ensure proper washing, rinsing, and spinning.

### The Roles of electronic components

Microcontroller (Control Board):
This is the “brain” of the washing machine. It receives input from buttons and sensors, processes the information, and controls all operations such as wash time, spin speed, and sequence of actions.

Sensors:
- Water level sensor detects how much water is inside the drum.
- Temperature sensor ensures water is heated to the correct level.
- Load sensor helps adjust washing time and motor speed based on the weight of clothes.

Relays and Triacs:
These components act as electronic switches. They turn high-power parts like the motor, heater, and water pump on and off safely using low-power control signals.

Motor Driver Circuit:
Controls the speed and direction of the motor during washing and spinning cycles.

Display and Control Buttons:
Electronic displays (LED or LCD) show time, mode, and error messages, while buttons allow users to select washing programs.

Power Supply Circuit:
Converts the mains electricity into suitable low voltages required by electronic components.

Summary

Electronics make the washing machine automatic, efficient, and user-friendly. Instead of just supplying power (electricity), electronics control, monitor, and optimize how that power is used to wash clothes effectively.
