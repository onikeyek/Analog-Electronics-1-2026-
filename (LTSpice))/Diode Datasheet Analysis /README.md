## Diode Datasheet Analysis

**Diode name:** 1N4148  
**Manufacturer:** Vishay Semiconductors  
**Type:** Small signal fast switching diode 

## Electrical Characteristics (from datasheet)

**Forward voltage:** Forward voltage VF = 1 V (max) at IF = 10 mA 
At a forward current of 10 mA, the diode has a forward voltage of about 0.7–1 V. This means the diode needs roughly this voltage before it starts conducting current effectively.

**Maximum reverse voltage:** Repetitive peak reverse voltage VRRM = 100 V
This show the highest reverse voltage the diode can withstand repeatedly without entering breakdown or getting damaged.

*Maximum forward current:** Forward continuous current IF = 300 mA   Average forward current IF(AV) = 150 mA
This specifies the maximum current the diode can safely conduct in the forward direction during normal operation.

**Operating temperature range:** Junction temperature up to 175 °C    Storage temperature range −65 °C to +150 °C
The diode can operate reliably across a wide temperature range, making it suitable for both low- and high-temperature electronic environments.

## Application
The 1N4148 diode is widely used in high-speed switching and signal processing applications, such as logic circuits and signal clamping, because of its fast switching capability.
