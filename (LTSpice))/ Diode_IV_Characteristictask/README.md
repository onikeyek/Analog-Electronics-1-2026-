##  DC Sweep (Diode I–V) using LTspice

**Name:** Naimot Yekini

**DC Sweep Settings:**
- Source swept: V1
- Range: 0 V to 5 V
- Step size: 0.01 V

**Description:**
The plot shows the nonlinear I–V characteristic of the diode, with negligible current at low voltages and a rapid exponential increase in current after the forward voltage reaches approximately 0.7 V.
